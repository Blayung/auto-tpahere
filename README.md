# I have decided to stop supporting this mod since I have lost interest in it's functionality, and I think that not a lot of people will ever find it useful. Feel free to open pull requests, I will still reply to/accept them.

# Auto Tpahere Mod

## What is this mod?
This minecraft fabric mod allows you to send /tpahere command to all the players on the server with just one press of a key!  
  
**This mod currently supports only 1.19.3 (or potentially newer) versions of minecraft. To get support for older versions, try to use the older [releases](https://github.com/Blayung/auto-tpahere/releases).**

## How to compile this mod?
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Blayung/auto-tpahere.git; cd auto-tpahere`
2. Compile the mod: `./gradlew build`
3. Now the mod jar file should be here: `build/libs/auto-tpahere-1.0.3.jar`
